NAME

    OP - Compact Perl 5 class prototyping with object persistence

SYNOPSIS

      use OP;

      create "My::Class" => { };

    Using the OP module initializes all built-in object types, and causes
    strict, diagnostics, OP::Class, OP::Type, Perl6::Subs, and Error to be
    imported by the caller.

DESCRIPTION

    Compact and concise class prototyping, with object persistence.

    OP is a Perl 5 dialect for deriving object classes and database
    schemas. Apps developed and executed under OP have a greater degree of
    formality and consistency than one may be accustomed to seeing in Perl.

GETTING STARTED

    See OP.pm for a high level overview of the OP framework.

    Subclassing instructions are provided in the "Subclassing" section of
    OP. Additional examples are outlined in OP::Class.

    Instance variable assertions are outlined in OP::Type and OP::Subtype.

    See Perl6::Subs for an overview of the Perl 6-style methods used by OP.

    See Error for an overview of exception handling in Perl 5.
